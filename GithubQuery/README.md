# Github Query!

This is the Github query app that students build during the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course at Udacity.

This is my work in progress that will gain functionality as the lessons are completed. I will not be running the gradle.build.clean
until the project is complete. When done it will allow a user to search repositories based on an entered keyword and sort the results by the number of stars! (api call).

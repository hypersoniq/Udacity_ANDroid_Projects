# Github Query!

This is the Github query app that students build during the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course at Udacity.

Program functions to both present the query built with your search and to display raw JSON data returned. Works as presented, not a visually appealing app!

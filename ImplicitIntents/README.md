# Implicit Intents - Another toy App!

This is the Implicit Intents toy app that students build during the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course at Udacity.

3 of 4 buttons launch implicit intents. The 4th SHOULD open the calculator, but does not. It is replaced by a Toast message... but it would be nice to figure out how to make it work. Thanks for overlooking an example of this developer.android.com ...

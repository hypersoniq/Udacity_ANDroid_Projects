# RecyclerView Toy App!

This is the recycler view app that students build during the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course at Udacity.

scrolling demonstrates the RecyclerView in action. Better memory management vs. ListView. Clicking on any item displays a toast message.

# Onward and Upward Android World!

This is my collection of Android applications created as part of the free courses contained in the
[Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801 "Udacity Android Developer ND")

The apps as well as this repository are works in progress.
:wrench:

All apps will be cleaned when finished to reduce file size, so a rebuild will be needed to run them.

After completing the Android Basics Nanodegree, I have decided to begin taking the free modules contained within the next level of Android developer training available at Udacity. Should the Google challenge scholarship be issued in the future, I will apply to get the official certificate. For now, I want to continue to develop Android dev skills and the best way to do that is to build projects, which will be contained here.
